# Bitskins Bot

## Getting Started

See `Prerequisites`.

After `npm install` ...

At the root of the directory: `touch .env`
This file is ignored in `.gitignore`

OR Get it from our shared cloud storage.

------------------------------------------------------------------

In a separate terminal, run `start-mongod.sh`. 

Then, run `npm run test` to make sure everything is configured correctly.

Finally, run `npm run start` (or `docker-compose up --build`) and see terminal output.

## Prerequisites

+ [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/) (Ubuntu Installation is linked. Run `install-mongodb.sh` in `sudo bash`)

+ Docker (Optional -- See Docker-Windows.md for further instruction). Change `USING_DOCKER` in `.env` to `1`.


## Program Entry

Entry is in `src/index.ts`, which can also be found in `package.json`, specifically under the `start` script.

Or, you can run `docker-compose up --build`

## Tests

Tests are located under `src/test`, and test files follow `*.test.ts`

To run tests, run `npm run test`

## Configuration Files

+ `package.json` &rarr; node config
+ `tsconfig.json` &rarr; typscript config
+ `.env` &rarr; Environment variables containing Node variables, API keys, secrets, and other configurations (gitignore-ed)

## Algorithm

1. Skin is listed on bitskins. The listed event is fired and a signal is sent to us.

[Purchase Logic in `onListed.ts`]

2. Our program (the script) makes a decision if this event shows a good purchase and buys it. The decision will be based off of several factors, detailed below.

3. We either send or donâ€™t send the API command to buy the item listed in the event fired in step 1. 

4. We get a confirmation on if the item was sold to us, or has been sold to someone else. 

[End Purchase Logic]

5. If the item was not sold to us, log it, and then return to step 1.

6. If the item was sold to us, proceed to step 5

7. List the item we just bought at a markup. The marked-up price will be based off of several factors, detailed below.

8. Wait until the item sells.

[Cron Job]

9. If the item does not sell within a certain time (this time will be detailed), then lower the price by x%. This is detailed below

[End Cron Job]

10. Use new funds to buy skins: Rinse and repeat
